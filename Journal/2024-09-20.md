I still want to finish The Book and get some closure and organize my thoughts around it, but I'll probably allocate my time to other things in the next season.

I need to get back into exercising. I don't really feel that this pace of learning and working is sustainable on its own, and I'll need to get back into training to keep my [[It's not about time, it's about energy|energy]] levels and health.
