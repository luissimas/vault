This weekend I reflected a bit on [[Go vs Rust]]. Although I think [[Go]] makes more sense for me now I'll just stick with learning [[Rust]] for a few more weeks until I build a couple of projects with it to get a real feel for the language. After that I'll probably will focus entirely on [[Incus]].

The only work that I did until now regarding [[Incus]] was setup a local install on some MGC VMs. To be honest I got a bit distracted with provisioning the VMs using [[Terraform]] and did not actually bootstrapped the Incus cluster yet. In the midst of this I found a bug in the MGC terraform provider and reported it, so that was nice.

I'm also starting to think about keeping a personal changelog. But I'm not sure if it really fits my workflow right now. I should probably just get back into journaling more frequently, as it allows me to clear up my daily thinking.
