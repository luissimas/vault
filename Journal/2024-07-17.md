Today I wrote about the [[Shiny object syndrome]]. It started as a note like any other, but after adding an image and a bit more structure to it I thought it was good enough to turn it into a short blog post, and so I did. It's nice to see how I can integrate the blog into my notetaking workflow. I want to keep the blog as something totally secondary, but in the long term it can still be beneficial for my career and writing development. Making a blog post is a totally optional but viable last step of my note taking process.
