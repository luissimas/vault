Woke up and did a bit of studying for my the last test of the semester, so no progress on any side projects today. More and more I feel like there's a constant context switch between my side learning and university. I guess this is a bit inevitable, but I can minimize it by just picking disciplines that are better aligned with my interests on a given semester.
