# OCaml
I'm learning OCaml through [this textbook](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2019sp/textbook/), which is accompanied by [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLre5AT9JnKShBOPeuiD9b-I4XROIJhkIU).

## History
OCaml comes from the ML family of languages.

## Features
- Algebraic datatypes
- Pattern matching
- Static type-checking
- Type inference
- Parametric polymorphism
- Modules

## Notes
You **can** use type annotations, but you almost **never need** to do it, because overall the type inference is very good.
