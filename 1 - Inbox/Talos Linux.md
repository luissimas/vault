Talos Linux is an minimal and immutable [[Linux]] distribution with the single purpose of providing [[Kubernetes]] nodes. The distribution is very unique in the sense that it uses the Linux kernel, but everything above that is written from scratch in [[Go]].

I'd like to try it on my homelab, but I'm currently waiting on the 1.8 release, which is tracked by this issue: https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/issues/8367.
