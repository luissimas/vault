InfluxDB is a time series database. I've started using it on my [[Zettelkasten exporter]] project.

Key concepts:

| InfluxDB    | Relational database |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| Measurement | Table               |
| Bucket      | Database            |

- A bucket can have a **retention period** to determine for how long to persist the measurements
