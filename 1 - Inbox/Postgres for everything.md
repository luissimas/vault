Today someone showed me a project that aims to implement a MongoDB compatible database on top of PostgreSQL using JSONB called [Pongo](https://github.com/event-driven-io/Pongo). It led me to a rabbit hole of people that use PostgreSQL for everything, which is quite interesting specially since the [[Elixir]] community seems to be on the same track with tools like [Oban](https://github.com/sorentwo/oban).
