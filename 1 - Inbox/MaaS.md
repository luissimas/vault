Metal as a Service (MaaS) is the concept of providing bare metal machines (without an operating system) as a service. The key idea here is to be able to access the hardware directly, enabling the consumer of this service to install a custom OS for compliance or performance reasons.

The only implementation that I know of this concept [Canonical MaaS](https://maas.io/).
