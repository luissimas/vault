# Lógica Digital
Lógica Digital é a disciplica que introduz a base para qualquer conceito relacionado a circuitos digitais. O curso todo foi baseado no livro que se encontra nas referências dessa nota. As notas estão organizadas de acordo com os capítulos e seções do livro.

## Chapter 1
This chapter introduces the process of designing digital circuits, as well as the [[Digital representation of information|digital representation of information]].

## Chapter 2
This chapter is where things really start, it introduces the fundamental concepts to design digital circuits:  
[[Logic functions]] 
[[Boolean algebra]]
[[Logic synthesis]]
[[Verilog|Introduction to Verilog]]

## Chapter 3 (sections 3.1 to 3.5)
This chapter presents the topics involving arithmetic circuits and operations:
[[Positional number representation]]
[[Arithmetic logic circuits]]
[[Arithmetic circuits in Verilog]]
[[Representation of numbers in Verilog]]

## Chapter 4 
This chapter presents some interesting combinational circuits:
[[Multiplexers]]
[[Encoders and decoders]]

## Chapter 5
Here we were introduced to circuits that can store information, these circuits are called [[Sequential circuits|sequential circuits]]. We also were introduced to the different elements that are used to store information:
[[Latches]]
[[Flip-Flops]]
[[Registers]]
[[Counters]]
[[Implementation of storage in Verilog]]
[[Non-blocking assignments]]
[[Timing analysis]]

## Chapter 6
In this chapter we continue to explore the [[Sequential circuits|sequential circuits]], learning more formal ways of describing those circuits and new design techniques.
[[Finite state machines]]
[[State Diagram and Table]]
[[Designing sequential circuits]]
[[Finite state machines in Verilog]]
[[State minimization]]

## Chapter 7
In the final chapter covered by the course, we are presented to some more aspects of digital systems.
[[Bus structure]]
