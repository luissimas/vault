# Hash tables
A hash table is a data structure that allows us to search, insert and delete data all in $\text{O}(1)$ (constant time). That can be acomplished by combining an array and a mapping function (aka hash function), those are the two components of a hash table.


- A hash function is a function where you put any type of data and get back a number.
- A hash table is a data structure that combines an array with a hash function, the hash table uses the hash function to figure out in what index of the array it will store the data.
- We need do avoid collisions
- Learn hash functions
- Make a good hash function and everything will be ok
