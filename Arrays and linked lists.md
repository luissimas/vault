# Arrays and linked lists
These are the two basic data structures, they differ a lot, so there are multiple uses for both of them.

## Linked lists
In linked lists the elements aren't stored in a single sequence of memory blocks. What happens is that each element stores the address for the next element. This allows the items in a liked list to be spread across multiple non-sequential memory addresses
Here's a visual representation of how elements in a linked list are disposed in the memory:

The nature of linked lists implies in some interesting characteristics:
- Items can be easily added or deleted without the need to move the existing ones.
- The elements can only be read sequentially.

## Arrays
Arrays are probably the most common and simple way to arrange a sequence of different elements of data from the same type. Inserting items in a array is not that simple, since an array require a fixed area of memory with blocks in sequence. The main advantage of the arrays are that we always know the addre
