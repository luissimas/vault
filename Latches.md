# Latches
Latches are the base structures that allows circuits to store information, there are several implementations of latches. The main idea is that a latch recieves two inputs: *Set* and *Reset*. The circuit is implemented in a way that when both inputs are $0$, last stated is maintained with no change.
## Basic Latch
This is the core structure of every latch, here we have the basic behaviour. It's important to note that when both inputs are equal to $1$ we can't predic the behaviour of the circuit.
