This is my personal [[Zettelkasten]] containing some notes that I've written on various topics. Fell free to take a look.

> [!NOTE]
> This website is still under construction. I still need to figure out how to organize all of this and refine some notes, but done is better than perfect.

Lately I've been very interested in [[Kubernetes]] and getting some practice with it in my [[Homelab]]. Besides that, I'm currently learning [[Rust]] and want to make a few projects with it.

You can explore the notes by using the search function or by using some of the [Indexes](./Indexes/). If you're a recruiter, you might want to checkout my [[Resume]].
