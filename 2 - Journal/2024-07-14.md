My attention is a bit divided lately. I've finished the initial development of the [[Zettelkasten exporter]] and now I feel a bit lost. I want to learn more about Cloud Native stuff and Kubernetes on my home lab, but at the same time I also want to learn more about web design and being a full stack developer with [[Phoenix]]. I need to get some closure on those ideas that are open in my head so I can focus my attention on one thing.

I've been learning a bit about [[Web scraping]] just to explore the idea and to learn more about the available tools. I'm also enjoying a lot writing Python lately, so it's nice to explore another area where it's a good fit for the job.

Plan for closing out those open ideas:

- [X] Write about the [[Homelab]]. What is my goal with it? How is it going?
- [ ] Write about the [[Zettelkasten exporter]]. How did I do it? What were the outcomes?
- [ ] What are my short term goals? What do I want to achieve in 3 months?
- [ ] Create an active/maintenance strategy for the areas of my life, like Cal Newport described for managing multiple interests

Honestly, I'm pretty stable with my Homelab. I have my services running and I can debug them when I need. I'd say it's fine to put it in maintenance mode right now. But I need to solidify the knowledge of this project in a note to get some closure.
