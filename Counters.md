# Counters
Counter circuits are very useful for a series of aplications. They can be implemented using the [[Arithmetic logic circuits#Adder and subtractor circuit|adder/subtractor]] circuit or with [[Flip-Flops|flip-flops]]. Since the focus here is to increment or decrement a count by 1, it's much more efficient to use the implementation with flip-flops.

## Asynchronous Counters
The simplest way to implement counters is using T flip-flops. The problem with this implementation is that there is a propagation delay in the circuit.


We can also implement a down-counter using the same elements

## Synchronous Counters

## Counters with Parallel Load

## Reset Synchronization

## BCD Counter
