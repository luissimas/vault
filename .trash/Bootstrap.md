Bootstrap is a flexbox-based very popular [[CSS]] framework that uses a 12 column system. He offers a easy and efficient way of creating nice-looking responsive design websites.
It's based on classes, so you don't have to write CSS at all, just assign the class to the elements in your [[HTML]] file and the correspond styles will be applied.
