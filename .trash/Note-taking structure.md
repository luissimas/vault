# Note structure
The notes follow the template available in the [[Note-taking structure#Templates]] folder, the main notes used for actually knowledge linking follow the folowing structure based on the Zettelkastan method:
![[note_template]]
# File structure
I'm trying to set up my vault in a way that requires the minimun amount of folders possible, because I think that complex and rigid structures defeat the poupose of linking knowledge. Still, I'm sticking with some folder structure just to keep the files organized to facilitate mass editing or management in general.
The file structure that I use in this vault follows this scheme:
## Root
This is where all the notes are created and the information is captured in a fast and simple way, to remove friction. From here the notes are lapidated and go to the [[Note-taking structure#Processed]] folder.
## Attachments
Here are stored all the assets and files that are used in the notes.
## Templates
I'm planning on doing some templates for my notes, they'll be stored here.
## Processed
After formatting, reviewing and linking the notes they are stored here.
## Daily
This folder stores the daily notes that I take on my journal.
