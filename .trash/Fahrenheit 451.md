# Fahrenheit 451
This is a book that i've been wanting to read for quite some time. I think my friend recommended in the beginning of high school. Well, I finally read it.

- Entertainment industry critique
- Value of a good read, textures and nuances
- The real value of the books is what can become part of yourself
