CSS is used to add style to the web pages. the main pourpose of CSS is to separete style from content. It's called cascate style because it defines the priority of the appearence of the elements.
The priorities in order are:
1. !important
2. inline style (inside the element)
3. style defined in the head
4. external style imported


The main structure of a CSS class is:
```
class1{
	attribute: value;
}

class2{
	attribute: value:
}
```

Honestly working with CSS is very boring, so just learn the basics and then jump to a framework like [[Bootstrap]].
