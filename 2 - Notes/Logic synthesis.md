# Logic synthesis
The process os logic synthesis consists in: given a logic function with a desired output, simplify the function so it can be implemented in a circuit with the desired behavior and a minimal cost.
The are serveral ways to realize the logic synthesis, in the book we are presented to two ways:
1. Obtaining the *canonical expression* using [[Minterms and maxterms|minterms or maxterms]] and then minimizing the expression using [[Boolean algebra]].
2. Obtaining the minimal-cost expression using [[Karnaugh maps]].
