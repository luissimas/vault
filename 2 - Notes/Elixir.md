Elixir is a dynamically typed, high-level programming language focused on **concurrency** and **fault tolerance**. It runs on the [[BEAM]] virtual machine, therefore it has the most solid foundation that a language can have.

I really like the [[Erlang]] foundations and the fact that, like Erlang, Elixir is not functional as a goal in itself, but as a consequence of the goal of being a fault tolerant and concurrent language.

I'm very biased for liking the language, but for me Elixir is the **obvious choice for writing long lived servers**. With [[Phoenix]] and [[LiveView]], its also the obvious choice for writing full stack web applications.

The tooling is good, but not as good as [[Go]]'s. The ecosystem still lacks a good LSP (currently there are three projects with no clear winner).
