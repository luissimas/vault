A hardware description language (HDL) is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of digital logic circuits.
A HDL may look like a [[Programming language|programming language]], but they differ in the sense that: a programming language specifies instructions that are meant to be executed by a *software*, while a HDL *describes the behavior* of a electronic circuit. This implies that in HDL the instructions are executed no in a sequence, but in parallel.
