Mind maps are a great way to visualize project and task dependencies in general. I'm enjoying using them now in Obsidian, and it was nice to found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1TzYZ6kf8U) talking about it before I even rationalized that idea.

I'm constantly thinking about different ways of visualizing data, and I want to try to use more mind maps to have overviews of concepts and even task management.
