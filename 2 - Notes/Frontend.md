I want to learn front-end development. I'm mostly a back-end developer with a big interest for infrastructure, but I want to be well rounded in all aspects of development. The goal is not to master front-end development, but to become competent in this discipline and to be able to create products to end users.

I'll start by learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, making some static pages using products that i like as an inspiration. Then I'll use that foundation to familiarize myself with [[TailwindCSS]]. With that I hope to be able to build projects with [[Phoenix LiveView]] without getting completely frustrated with my lack of front-end skills.

Here are some design inspirations to get started:
