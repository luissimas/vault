Sequential circuits are a class of digital circuits in which the output values depends not only on the input values but also on the past * state* of the circuit. This circuits utilize storage elements that store the values of logic signals.

There are two approaches when designing sequential circuits:
- Moore type
Circuits whose outputs depend only on the state of the circuit are called of *Moore type*
- Mealy type
Circuits whose outputs depend on both the state and the primary inputs are called *Mealy type*

These circuits *can* be represented in a more abstract way by [[Finite state machines|finite state machines]].
