Reading [[Deep Work]] I came about a chapter in which [[Theodore Roosevelt]] is used as an example of focus and work with intensity. I find very interesting that all these famous polymaths have that variable in common: **intensity**. Interestingly enough, lately my training philosophy is turning much more towards consistency and intensity instead of pure volume, which seems to be the norm.

In fact, doing things with **quality, focus and commitment allows for extracting great value** from whatever you are doing. And perhaps even more important, it **frees up time so you can diversify** your activities, and therefore explore life in both more depth and breath than you previously though was possible.

Why don't I commit to this? What am I fearing? What's holding me back? Identifying these elements and dealing with them is an important step towards improvement, but the first step, as noted in [[Atomic Habits]], is to identify what is it that I want to achieve, what is the **identity** that I want to pursue?
