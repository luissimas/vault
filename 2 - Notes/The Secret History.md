# The Secret History
Started reading this book by recommendation of R.C. Waldun. While reading this I can say that is inevitable to dive into this whole *Dark Academia* atmosphere. I bookmarked a few parts of the book that I want to put here later.
It's quite impressive - at least for me - how the Donna Tartt is able to paint this marvelous pictures in her narrative, the level of details and textures in this book are amazing.
