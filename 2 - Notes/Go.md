Go is a statically typed, high-level programming language. It was developed at Google with the goal of being **simple**, easy to learn and scalable. Go is garbage collected, but it has excellent performance and a low memory footprint when compared to other garbage collected languages.

Go's highlights are:

1. The CSP-style **concurrency model**, with lightweight, user space threads called goroutines and communication primitives at a language level through channels.
2. The **implicit interface implementation**, resulting in a sort of duck type experience in a statically typed language.

For me, programming in Go has a low-level feel very similar to C, but with **very good tooling** and a vast standard library that results in a very pleasant experience.
