I've been keeping this Zettelkasten for quite some time now, and I think it's time to share it with others.

I have had some occasions in which a colleague would ask: "could you send me those notes that you took on topic X?". My response to that usually goes something like: "Sure! They're just a bit scattered tho, give me a few minutes and I'll compile them into a PDF and send them to you". I'd be very nice if I could just send them a link to an entrypoint in my Zettelkasten and share not only the content, but the structure of thought and connections between that topic and other areas of my life.

Another big factor in this is getting feedback. I've done a few blog posts and it's really nice to have some feedback on the output of my thinking. Besides that, the sole feeling of being able to receive feedback on something already increases my motivation and amount of effort that I'm willing to put into it.
