I want to be able to build full solutions from scratch. I'm mostly a backend developer, so I have a huge gap in my [[Frontend]] skills. I want to correct that to be able to really deliver full solutions.

The plan:

1. Learn the foundations of web design
2. Apply those to design a tool for myself
3. Implement such tool using [[Phoenix]]

Of course, none of these are measurable, so here's some actual goals:

- [ ] Setup Figma and get familiar with the basics
- [ ] Design a simple site with at least 3 pages, probably copying from a tutorial or something
- [ ] Formalize my understanding of the fundamentals in one or more notes
- [ ] Design the first page of my own tool from scratch
