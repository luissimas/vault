I'm learning [[Rust]] for the past few weeks and I feel like I'm almost at a point where I can build something useful with it without banging my head too much. I've been wanting to aggregate the several scripts that I have to manage my [[Zettelkasten]] into a more structured CLI.

The idea is to encapsulate several aspects of the process, from creating new notes to managing front matter metadata and applying formatting to notes.

Planned features:

- Create new notes and open the editor
- Add tags and arbitrary attributes to notes
- Enforce my preferred formatting
- Manage git operations and publishing with [[Quartz]]
