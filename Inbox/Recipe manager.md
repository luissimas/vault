I've been using [mealie](https://mealie.io/) for a while and it does the basic job, but it's not a great experience. Since I want to get better at [[Fullstack|fullstack development]], I want to build an alternativa to mealie using [[Phoenix]].

# Core features

- Users can register and login
- Create recipes and ingredients
- Keep a pantry/shopping list
- Have a cooking mode with voice controls
- Tagging system
- Import from other websites, YouTube etc (some webscraping needed)
- Give suggestions and new ideas of recipes (some AI needed)
- Follow websites and YouTube channels and automatically import new recipes

A scoring system does not make sense, since those are my recipes anyway.
