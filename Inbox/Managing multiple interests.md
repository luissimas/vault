The function that relates the time that you put into something and the rewards you get back is not linear. This is why it is important to focus on less things at a time instead of spreading your efforts into multiple smaller endeavors.

One main project of focus at a time. The other areas get a baseline effort just for maintenance. The idea is to choose a project relevant for one area of my interests and focus on it for at least 3 months.

> Done is better than good.
