The function that relates the time that you put into something and the rewards you get back is not linear. This is why it is important to focus on less things at a time instead of spreading your efforts into multiple smaller endeavors.

The idea is to choose a single project relevant for one area of my interests and focus on it for at least 3 months. The other areas get a baseline effort just for maintenance.

> Done is better than good.

> Falling in love with starting is easy. Falling in love with finishing is hard.

Things to keep in mind:

[[Intensity in life]]

# Main areas

Those are my main areas of pursuit, ranked from most to least important.

1. [[Fitness]] - A sick man can only desire one thing: to be healthy again. Maintaining fitness and health is the top priority to build a strong foundation to all other areas of life
2. [[Computer science]] - A broad topic, but it's my main passion. It also happens to be my professional area, so I'm always improving on it through my day job.
3. [[Language learning]] - The limits of my language are the limits of my world.
4. [[Philosophy]] - Understanding the world around me.

# Time management

Time is the main raw resource needed to pursuit my interests. Therefore, learning to better manage and use it more efficiently is the key to better results.

# Systems

My systems should support me and make easier to achieve my goals. The main benefits of a good system are:

1. I don't have to rely on my memory, thus I have more mental energy
2. Eliminate distractions
3. Keep me accountable on my goals
