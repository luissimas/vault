Fedora is a free and open source [[Linux]] distribution sponsored by [[Red Hat]]. I heard a lot of good things about it and decided to try it after my [[Ubuntu]] install broke.

In terms of stability and recency of packages, Fedora is in a sweet spot between [[Arch]] and [[Debian]]. Fedora is widely known for adopting new features for the Linux desktop such as [[Wayland]], [[Flatpak]] and [[Btrfs]], but at the same time it is a very stable distro.

So far I've been liking Fedora a lot. [[DNF]] is a very intuitive package manager and the vanilla [[Gnome]] experience is great.
