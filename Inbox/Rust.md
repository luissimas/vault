Rust is a systems programming language designed with performance and safety in mind. The idea is that the compiler is strict enough to catch a large class of bugs, including null pointers and concurrency bugs.

[[Immutability by default]]

Rust uses the concept of [[Ownership]] to safely manage memory without a [[Garbage Collector]].
