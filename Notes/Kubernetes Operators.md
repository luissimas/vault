In [[Kubernetes]], operator is a pattern that describes a software that runs in the cluster and manages applications and their resources. Typically, operators define custom resources to expose their functionality to cluster operators, that describe the state of a resource, and the operator works to ensure that this state is reflected in the cluster.

Examples of operators are:

- cert-manager
- sealed-secrets
- prometheus-operator
