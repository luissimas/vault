I want to be able to build full solutions from scratch. I'm mostly a backend developer, so I have a huge gap in my [[Frontend]] skills. I want to correct that to be able to really deliver full solutions.

I have solid backend foundations, so I don't expect to have problems with that. I really like [[Elixir]] and [[Phoenix]] because I can both move fast and have a high scaling ceiling with a very simple infrastructure. For the UI I'll use [[Phoenix LiveView]] for interactions and maybe just plain HTML for landing pages and static content. I'm not very familiar with [[Frontend]] development, and to be honest I just want to learn the bare minimum as I go. So I'll be using [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) as a CSS framework.
