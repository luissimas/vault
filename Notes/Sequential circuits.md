# Sequential circuits
Sequential circuits (also called *finite state machines*) are a class of digital circuits in which the output values depends not only on the input values but also on the past * state* of the circuit. This circuits utilize storage elements that store the values of logic signals.

## Moore type
Circuits whose outputs depend only on the state of the circuit are called of *Moore type*
## Mealy type
Circuits whose outputs depend on both the state and the primary inputs are called *Mealy type*
