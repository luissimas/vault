From as long as I remember, I've always liked to customize my computer environment. In 2020 I've started to thinker with Linux and I went deep into the ricing rabbit hole. Part of this rabbit hole also included text editors and other development tools. I've went from vscode to vim, from vim to neovim, from neovim to emacs and from emacs back to neovim.

This [video](https://youtu.be/a3ldC7LrPto) really resonates with me both because our journeys are similar but also because our philosophy around personal development environments are quite similar as well. I've spend a lot of time configuring my environment, time which from the outside seems like a huge waste. But I don't regret it at all. All this time thinkering and configuring improved me in ways I couldn't imagine at first, but most importantly: I had a lot of fun.

Even though my workflow has changed a bit and I've [[Switching to Ubuntu|switched to Ubuntu]], I still live in the terminal (that's one of the reasons why I ditched tiling window managers). It's very interesting to revisit this theme of personal development environments from a more mature perspective (recency bias, of course).
