Backtracking is a method based on trial and error. A algorithm using this method find a possible path to a solution and follows it until it finds a solution or an case in which there is no solution ahead. If the algorithm finds the case where there's no possible solution, it returns one step and search for another possible solution, and so on.
Here's a visual representation of a problem solution using a backtracking strategy:
