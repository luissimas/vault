When [[Managing multiple interests]] I mostly think in terms of how much time I have, but this is not the only variable here. We also have a **limited amount of energy and will power**, and those dictate **how well** we can use the **limited time** that we have.

We have **little to no control** over the total amount of **time** that we have. We have responsibilities that are not on our control at the moment, such as university, a day job or other responsibilities. Even if we didn't have those, there's still a hard limit of 24h in a day. But we do have **control over our energy and will power**. We have control over our habits and thinking to maximize the strength and energy of our bodies and minds.

[[Intensity in life]] is the way to maximize the density of our time. Since we can't buy ourselves more time, we should do things with intensity to get the most of the time we have.

With this in mind, we should identify activities that fuels our energy (both mentally and physically) and treat them as time investments. For me, those have been [[Fitness|exercising]] regularly, going on walks and eating more whole foods. Besides that, taking a break and playing games also proves to be a very good way to relax and put recurring problems aside.
