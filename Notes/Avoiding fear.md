The more we try to protect ourselves by avoiding fear and discomfort, the smaller and more closed our world gets, which in turn makes our comfort zone smaller, which makes the amount of things that causes us discomfort and fear grow even more.

We should strive to be courageous, flexible and step out of our comfort zone frequently. This is the only way to explore life and live without fear.
