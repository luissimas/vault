# Karnaugh maps
Karnaugh maps provide a graphical way of minimizing a logic function. The idea is to display the [[Minterms and maxterms|minterms or maxterms]] in a graph form that allows us to clearly see wich variables don't contribute to the output and then ommit them.
Honestly there's a lot to cover about Karnaugh maps, so below you can find the PDFs explaining how they work, also check section 2.11 in the [[Fundamentals_of_Digital_Logic.pdf|book]].
