I've started using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) to [[Publishing my Zettelkasten|publish my zettelkasten]] this week. So far it's been a great experience. The plugin system is quite well put together and the idea of having the entire source code within the repository allows for a lot of extensibility.

The only drawback so far has been the performance in watch mode. Any file update triggers a rebuild of the entire website, which usually just hangs and never finishes, so I have to kill the process and start it again.
