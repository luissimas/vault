Usually websites are not art pieces. They are tools and therefore should be intuitive and simple to use, allowing users to fulfill their intention with the least amount of time and friction possible.

# Layout

Everything is composed of a grid with rows and columns. Use consistent spacing between elements and use [[Flexbox]] to colapse columns into rows on smaller screen sizes.

# Typography

Just pick one font and scale it accordingly using https://typescale.com/.

1. Inter
2. Montserrat
3. DM Sans
4. Raleway
5. Roboto

# Colors

Less is more, pick a pallet from https://coolors.co/ and then choose a primary, secondary and accent color. The accent color will be used for buttons, icons and other graphics and interactive parts elements of the website. There should be another shade of the accent color to hover state of those elements.
