I want to learn front-end development. I'm mostly a back-end developer with a big interest for infrastructure, but I want to be well rounded in all aspects of development. The goal is not to master front-end development, but to become competent in this discipline and to be able to create products to end users.

The idea is to learn the bare minimum about [[Web design]] fundamentals and implementing them with HTML and CSS. With that I hope to be able to build projects with [[Phoenix LiveView]] without getting completely frustrated with my lack of front-end skills.

Here are some design inspirations to get started:
