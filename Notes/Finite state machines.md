Finite state machines are abstract models capable of describing the behavior of [[Sequential circuits|sequential circuits]]. A *finite state machine* must have the following attributes:
- A finite set of inputs
- A finite set of outputs
- A finite set o *states*
- A function that determine the next state
- A function that determine the output
- An initial state

We can represent an finite state machine using [[State diagram and table|state diagram and tables]].
