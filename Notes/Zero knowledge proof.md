Zero-knowledge proof is a [[Cryptography]] concept that describes a method in which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they posses knowledge about a piece of information without actually revealing that information.

It is trivial to prove the knowledge of some information by revealing it, but is hard to prove such knowledge without actually revealing the information. This is the fundamental problem that zero-knowledge proof systems aim to solve.
