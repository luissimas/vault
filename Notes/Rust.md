Rust is a systems programming language designed with performance and safety in mind. The idea is that the compiler is strict enough to catch a large class of bugs, including null pointers and concurrency bugs.

Rust mixes features from [[Functional languages]] (mostly [[OCaml]]) with low-level concepts and imperative programming constructs. Combined with the philosophy of [[Zero cost abstraction]], this results in a high level systems programming language with great abstractions without giving up performance or control over the lower level details.
