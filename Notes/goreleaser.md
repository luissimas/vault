While searching for a tool to automate the releases of the [[Zettelkasten exporter]] using [[GitHub Actions]], I've stumbled upon the [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) tool. It automates the build process for multiple targets and the creation of GitHub releases for [[Go]] projects.

It has excellent documentation, uses very sensible defaults and it's really easy to use. So much that I though it deserved a note for itself.
