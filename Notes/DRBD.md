Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) is a distributed replicated storage system for [[Linux]]. It is implemented as a [[Kernel driver]].

DRBD allows us to replicate a [[Block device]] synchronously or asynchronously across multiple nodes, enabling the functionality of RAID-1 across a network.
