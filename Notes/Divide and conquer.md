Divide and conquer is a general [[Recursion|recursive]] technique to solve more complex problems with algorithms. Since it's a recursive technique, the first step when solving a problem using *divide and conquer* is always determining the base cases of the problem. After that we can divide the problem in small steps until we reach the base case.

> When you're solving a problem involving array by recursion, usually the base case is either an empty array or an array with one element.
