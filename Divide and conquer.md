# Divide and conquer
Divide and conquer is a general recursive technique to solve more complex problems with algorithms. Since it's a recursive technique, the first step when solving a problem using *divide and conquer* is always determining the base cases of the problem. After that we can divide the problem in small steps until we reach the base case.
